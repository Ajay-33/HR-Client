        "about": "As a UC Berkeley Psychology PhD graduate with over a decade of experience in human-centered research, my work spans various fields, including language, cognition, healthcare, and technology. I'm deeply interested in how my expertise can be applied to enhance human-technology interactions, with a focus on improving user experiences and outcomes. I dedicated my time at UC Berkeley to investigating how language shapes cognition, especially the development of stereotypes. This work solidified my skills in experimental design and data analysis and allowed me to develop a parallel interest in Large Language Models and AI technology. I am eager to bring this blend of human-centered research and technological curiosity to the forefront of product development and AI research. I've had the opportunity to apply my skills in the tech industry, particularly in the AI space. As a Product Innovation Intern at Microsoft + Nuance, I contributed to developing a new cutting-edge conversational AI product aimed at enhancing clinical workflows and reducing clinician burnout. My role involved leveraging my psychological expertise to align product development with user needs, along with shaping training and adoption strategies for our innovative solution. I am now actively seeking roles where I can utilize my expertise in this exciting field. If you're interested in collaborating or discussing opportunities, I welcome you to reach out and connect with me.",

On LinkedIn, I share stories, research, anecdotes, and lessons on creativity that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll help you bash the 800-pound gorilla in the room aka creative block.Why creativity you ask?AI might have a million advantages, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one disadvantage that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largely overlooked.The more we outsource our creative thinking to AI, the more our creative muscles atrophy.Which is a pretty nice way to get stuck in an echo chamber of ideas.

Committed to continual learning and leveraging the latest in machine learning advancements to unravel complex data patterns to guide pivotal strategic decisions in real-world scenarios.I am currently a 2nd year Masters student specializing in Data Science at the University of Southern California. An essential part of my academic journey is my involvement in research at the USC Information Sciences Institute where I am advised by Prof. Filip Ilievski and Prof. Jay Pujara. Here, I delve deep into the realms of knowledge graphs, natural language processing, and the vast expanse of social media. My research pursuits do not stop at just this. I'm engaged in a collaborative DARPA project, a joint endeavor that spans the expertise at USC ISI and ICT. The crux of this project revolves around knowledge management and granular knowledge retrieval. Within the broader spectrum of NLP, my research aspirations center around developing explainable and efficient agents tailored for a range of tasks. Simultaneously, my affinity for cloud technologies drives me to integrate them for enhanced scalability and speed in various projects.Parallel to my academic responsibilities, I've been actively participating in the Google Summer of Code. In its 2023 edition, I embarked on a project titled \"Question-Answering over DBpedia with Pretrained Auto-regressive Models\". The primary aim was the continued pretraining, finetuning, and optimization of an opensource code model, notably known as Starcoder1B. This engagement followed my previous successful stint in the 2022 Google Summer of Code, where I contributed to \"Template Discovery for Neural Question Answering over DBpedia\". This ambitious project had set its sights on crafting a diverse dataset, one that boasted millions of rows. The ultimate goal was to ensure the efficient translation of natural language questions into SPARQL.",

Frank and Noah Goodman as part of the Language & Cognition (LangCog) and Computation & Cognition (CoCo) Labs. I am grateful to receive support from Amazon Science, Microsoft AFMR, and StabilityAI.My ultimate goal is to blend knowledge from multiple disciplines to advance AI research. My current research centers around aligning foundation model and human learning and capabilities, particularly in reasoning, generalization, and efficiency. I have explored ways to improve the controllability of language and visual generation models, and integrate structured and multimodal information to enhance their reasoning capabilities.I'm investigating psychologically and cognitively inspired methods for continual learning, self-improvement, and advanced reasoning in foundation models. I'm also exploring methods to bridge the data efficiency gap between human and model learning while shedding further light on human cognitive models and our efficient language and vision acquisition capabilities.Previously, I was a master's student at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), where I worked with Eduard Hovy and Malihe Alikhani on language generation, data augmentation, and commonsense reasoning. Before that, I was an undergraduate student at the University of Waterloo, where I worked with Jesse Hoey on dialogue agents and text generation.My research contributions have been recognized with several publications at major conferences and a best paper award at INLG 2021. I am also an Honorable Mention for the Jessie W.H. Zou Memorial Award and CRA Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher Award.I am a co-instructor for the Stanford CS25 Transformers course, and mentor and advise several students. I also led the organization of CtrlGen, a controllable generation workshop at NeurIPS 2021, and was involved in the GEM benchmark and workshop for NLG evaluation.In my free time, I enjoy gaming, playing the piano and guitar, martial arts, and table tennis.

My current focus at Amazon is on training and developing responsible Large Language Models (LLMs) that are capable of making explainable, fair and unbiased decisions for recruitment and performing Human Resources related tasks at scale. Prior to this, I worked on developing and deploying Spoken Language Understanding models for Conversational AI at Alexa AI. Considering that these models are trained on sensitive information, I am also deploying privacy-preserving machine learning algorithms (based on federated learning, PII detection and differential privacy) and bias-mitigation algorithms for large-scale Natural Language Understanding systems. I also have a deep experience in speech and music processing, especially in speech recognition, speech separation, speech production, acoustic modelling and acoustic event detection. My graduate dissertation on \"De-mystifying End-to-End Deep Learning Based Speech-Separation Models\" demonstrated the vulnerabilities of certain deep learning models to real-life inputs, paving the way to more scalable and robust models.My work in privacy attacks on Natural Language Processing models, speech separation, acoustic event detection and speech inversion has resulted in publications at top-tier venues such as ACL, ICASSP and Interspeech.I enjoy working on research problems and pushing my solutions into production for wide impact, and am always interested to learn about new products and ideas.",

        "about": "I am passionate about solving impactful user problems by leading the life-cycle of innovating state-of-the-art in AI, building proof-of-concept experiences, and shipping them to users. I am an experienced leader who has led research, research-to-product, and product ML teams innovating in Generative AI and Assistant technology, garnering executive interest. In addition to the technical leadership, my strength is to solve big problems by bringing together smart people, often in distributed locations, in different functions. I love mentoring and growing people.I believe AI will become a much bigger part peoples' lives over the next few decades and I want to be a small part of the big revolution. I led the team towards Meta's first GenAI media product -- AI Stickers. I am currently working on LLMs. Previously, I was at Meta's AI arm, FAIR -- checkout our most recent work at https://makeavideo.studio (2nd biggest AI moment in Q3 '22).I was also responsible for scoping and leading the medium-to-long term org strategy for moon shot NLP projects in the Meta's Assistant org. I led the strategy across 3 orgs to identify and solve big impactful user problems using NLP innovation. I shipped products on Meta hardware, Portal and Ray-Ban smart glasses.I got a PhD in NLP from Stanford University under Chris Manning in bootstrapping information extraction using very few examples, using human-in-the-loop (very similar as the current \"Alignment\" research). I have a Masters from UT Austin where I worked on multi-modal vision+NLP models.Publication list: https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=CLZ9dLoAAAAJ",

Some of the projects I have worked on include flavors of load balancing of requests, scalable model design for language understanding scenarios, REST APIs, long running operations, semantic and syntactic features of language, and model evaluation. My projects also span usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) for product improvement - including OpenAI functions, prompt engineering and RAG evaluation. I particularly enjoy building and using model evaluation strategies.- Through my time at Microsoft, I have worked on projects in various stages through initiation and ideation in quick proof-of-concepts on different model architectures and Large Language Models, contributed to open-source, built tooling, and contributed to live services.- I have worked on both Chit-Chat and Task-Oriented Conversational AI, with our work on Chit Chat conversation being open sourced as Microsoft ICECAPS (Published in ACL 2019)- I have also dabbled in spoken language systems that use speech as the primary input.",

Committed to continual learning and leveraging the latest in machine learning advancements to unravel complex data patterns to guide pivotal strategic decisions in real-world scenarios.I am currently a 2nd year Masters student specializing in Data Science at the University of Southern California. An essential part of my academic journey is my involvement in research at the USC Information Sciences Institute where I am advised by Prof. Filip Ilievski and Prof. Jay Pujara. Here, I delve deep into the realms of knowledge graphs, natural language processing, and the vast expanse of social media. My research pursuits do not stop at just this. I'm engaged in a collaborative DARPA project, a joint endeavor that spans the expertise at USC ISI and ICT. The crux of this project revolves around knowledge management and granular knowledge retrieval. Within the broader spectrum of NLP, my research aspirations center around developing explainable and efficient agents tailored for a range of tasks. Simultaneously, my affinity for cloud technologies drives me to integrate them for enhanced scalability and speed in various projects.Parallel to my academic responsibilities, I've been actively participating in the Google Summer of Code. In its 2023 edition, I embarked on a project titled \"Question-Answering over DBpedia with Pretrained Auto-regressive Models\". The primary aim was the continued pretraining, finetuning, and optimization of an opensource code model, notably known as Starcoder1B. This engagement followed my previous successful stint in the 2022 Google Summer of Code, where I contributed to \"Template Discovery for Neural Question Answering over DBpedia\". This ambitious project had set its sights on crafting a diverse dataset, one that boasted millions of rows. The ultimate goal was to ensure the efficient translation of natural language questions into SPARQL.",

Frank and Noah Goodman as part of the Language & Cognition (LangCog) and Computation & Cognition (CoCo) Labs. I am grateful to receive support from Amazon Science, Microsoft AFMR, and StabilityAI.My ultimate goal is to blend knowledge from multiple disciplines to advance AI research. My current research centers around aligning foundation model and human learning and capabilities, particularly in reasoning, generalization, and efficiency. I have explored ways to improve the controllability of language and visual generation models, and integrate structured and multimodal information to enhance their reasoning capabilities.I'm investigating psychologically and cognitively inspired methods for continual learning, self-improvement, and advanced reasoning in foundation models. I'm also exploring methods to bridge the data efficiency gap between human and model learning while shedding further light on human cognitive models and our efficient language and vision acquisition capabilities.Previously, I was a master's student at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), where I worked with Eduard Hovy and Malihe Alikhani on language generation, data augmentation, and commonsense reasoning. Before that, I was an undergraduate student at the University of Waterloo, where I worked with Jesse Hoey on dialogue agents and text generation.My research contributions have been recognized with several publications at major conferences and a best paper award at INLG 2021. I am also an Honorable Mention for the Jessie W.H. Zou Memorial Award and CRA Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher Award.I am a co-instructor for the Stanford CS25 Transformers course, and mentor and advise several students. I also led the organization of CtrlGen, a controllable generation workshop at NeurIPS 2021, and was involved in the GEM benchmark and workshop for NLG evaluation.In my free time, I enjoy gaming, playing the piano and guitar, martial arts, and table tennis.

My current focus at Amazon is on training and developing responsible Large Language Models (LLMs) that are capable of making explainable, fair and unbiased decisions for recruitment and performing Human Resources related tasks at scale. Prior to this, I worked on developing and deploying Spoken Language Understanding models for Conversational AI at Alexa AI. Considering that these models are trained on sensitive information, I am also deploying privacy-preserving machine learning algorithms (based on federated learning, PII detection and differential privacy) and bias-mitigation algorithms for large-scale Natural Language Understanding systems. I also have a deep experience in speech and music processing, especially in speech recognition, speech separation, speech production, acoustic modelling and acoustic event detection. My graduate dissertation on \"De-mystifying End-to-End Deep Learning Based Speech-Separation Models\" demonstrated the vulnerabilities of certain deep learning models to real-life inputs, paving the way to more scalable and robust models.My work in privacy attacks on Natural Language Processing models, speech separation, acoustic event detection and speech inversion has resulted in publications at top-tier venues such as ACL, ICASSP and Interspeech.I enjoy working on research problems and pushing my solutions into production for wide impact, and am always interested to learn about new products and ideas.",
